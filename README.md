# DegreeSync

Project Overview
DegreeSync is a web application designed for students to calculate their semester and cumulative GPA. The application allows users to create an account, log in using their email and password, input their grades and course credit hours, and receive an accurate GPA calculation based on common grading standards.

Key Features:
Email Login: Users can create an account using their email and password to securely access the GPA calculator.
Semester GPA Calculation: Users can input their grades and credit hours for a given semester and receive an accurate GPA.
Cumulative GPA Calculation: The system allows users to calculate their cumulative GPA by considering multiple semesters' GPAs and credit hours.
Error Handling: The application provides feedback for invalid inputs, ensuring users are alerted when their data entries are incorrect.

Team Progress
Sprint 1: Requirements Gathering and Core Algorithm Development
In this sprint, the team focused on gathering the requirements and developing the core algorithm for GPA calculation. The main focus was:

Researching how GPAs are typically calculated.
Implementing the semester GPA calculation algorithm.
Starting the user login and authentication system using email and password.
The initial GPA calculation engine has been implemented and tested with sample data.
Getting the database setup for storing users.
